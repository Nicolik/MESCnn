# MESCnn
This repository contains an end-to-end pipeline, which we named *MESCnn* 
(*MESC* classification by *n*eural *n*etwork), for glomerular Oxford classification of 
whole slide images.

The Oxford Classification for IgA nephropathy is the most successful example of an
evidence-based nephropathology classification system. 

The aim of our study was to replicate the glomerular components of Oxford scoring with an end-to-end 
deep learning pipeline that involves automatic glomerular segmentation
followed by classification for mesangial hypercellularity (M), 
endocapillary hypercellularity (E), segmental sclerosis (S) and active crescents (C).

## Installation
In order to install the dependencies required to run MESCnn, check [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

## Associated Data
The source code is associated with:
- Trained Models for both segmentation and classification stages. 
Available on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/MESCnn/MESCnn).

- Sample WSIs to replicate the pipeline.
Available on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/MESCnn/MESCnn-Sample-Data).

## Usage of end-to-end pipeline
Two examples of usage of the end-to-end pipeline are reported:
- Replicate the pipeline from WSIs input. The example is reported in `run_wsi_tif.py`.
Please note that the code will perform automatic download of sample WSIs and weights of trained models.

- Replicate the pipeline from an existing QuPath project. The example is reported in `run_project_tif.py`.
Please note that the code will perform automatic download of an existing QuPath project,
sample WSIs and weights of trained models.

### Operations
The following operations are involved in the pipeline:

1) Tile the WSI. See `detection/qupath/tile.py` for more information.
2) Segment the tiled WSI. See `detection/qupath/segment.py` for more information.
Internally, it will convert the pickle Detectron2 annotations
to a QuPath project. See `detection/qupath/pkl2qu.py` for more information.
3) Eventually, manually revise the generated QuPath project.
4) Export the QuPath project annotations to JSON.
See `detection/qupath/qu2json.py` for more information.
5) Generate glomerular crops from JSON annotations.
See `detection/qupath/json2exp.py` for more information.
6) Perform classification of glomerular crops and 
Oxford classification at WSI-level. 
See `classification/inference/mesc/classify.py` for more information.

If you are interested in tiling and segmenting an entire QuPath project,
see `detection/qupath/segment_project.py` for more details.
